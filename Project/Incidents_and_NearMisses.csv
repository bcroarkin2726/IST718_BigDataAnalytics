It was during this time that a floor hand saw the cover plate to the topdrives junction box was lying on the rig floor near the v-door on the off drillers side (pic #1). Neither the company man nor any of our employees that were on the rig floor reported seeing or hearing when or how the junction box came in contact with anything, however they could see the J-box hanging off the top-drive. The job was immediately stopped and area secured. After further investigation it was determined that due to extreme rigorous shaking and vibration of the top drive, the spot welds on the junction box (pic #2) had broken loose allowing the top part of the  box to fall out forward away from top-drive and come in contact with the pivot mount of the derrick board. Because in the process of drilling, the highest point the top drive peaks out at would still have the J-box 10-12 feet below the derrick board, it was determined that the contact was made while pulling out a stand from the mouse hole.

EXTRACT FROM SAFETY ALERT: While running casing, Rig Manager began the lock out/tag out procedure to change out an actuator valve cap on the #2 hydraulic winch that was broken and leaking fluid. Employee assumed that he could isolate the power source by by-passing the valve and bleeding off the pressure. As he removed the damaged actuator valve, hydraulic fluid began to gush out and the spring inside the actuator disengaged which allowed the hydraulic winch to come out of neutral. This caused the winch to pull up on casing tongs that were attached to the A- leg and snap two  inch bolts securing the tongs. As a result the casing tongs were jerked up and fell to rig floor approximately 7-8 feet.
