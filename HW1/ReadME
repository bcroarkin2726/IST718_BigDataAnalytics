Objective • 
This case study provides an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to combine datasets and produce meaningful analysis. Specifically, we would like to provide a decision maker with more than just data—we want to provide insights, understanding, and wisdom. This exercise allows the student an opportunity to demonstrate progress (or mastery) of learning objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

1) Obtain data and understand data structures and data elements. 
2) Scrub data using scripting methods, to include debugging, for data manipulation in R and other tools. 
3) Explore data using essential qualitative analysis techniques, including descriptive statistics. 
4) Model relationships between data using the appropriate analytical methodologies matched to the information and the needs of clients and users. 
5) Interpret the data, model, analysis, and findings, and communicate the results in a meaningful way.
